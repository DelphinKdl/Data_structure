## What is it?

## Applications that use graphs.


1- Google Maps. Various locations are represented as vertices and the roads are represented as edges. They used graph theory a lot.

2- Facebook users. Each user is represented as a vertex.


3- Recommendations on e-commerce websites uses graph theory to recommend items od similar types to user's choice.

4- Transportation networks.

5- Computer network.
