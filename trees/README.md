# Tree data structure.

A tree is one of the non-linear data structure that we can use to store data in a computer.


## Types of trees in computer science.

1- Binary Tree.

2- Binary search tree.

3- AVL tree

4- Red-Black tree.

5- Splay tree

6- Tries

7- Ternary trees.

8- Heap Structure

and more


## Applications

There are many applications in different computer science domains that use trees such as artificial intelligence, security,
networking, compilers, graphics, and many more.


## Properties.

A tree composes of a collection of entities called "nodes", these nodes are connected to each other with "edge/link" which creates the whole hierarchy of a tree.


The top most node is called "ROOT", it a special node in the tree.


Nodes under the root are called "children".


Leaves or frontier, are the nodes who do not have children.


Height the length of the longest path from root to a leaf. This is the height of the tree.


Height of a node x is the path from this node x to the longest path to a leaf.


Tree can be called a recursive data structure since a the sub-parent can form a whole new tree. Recursive data structure a sub-tree of the whole tree can form a tree itself.



Depth of a certain node. So, the depth of node X is the length of the path from the root to this node X.


Depth of the root node is ZERO or o :).



Binary tree. This is the most famous. It is a tree representation in which each node has at most 2 node or less/
