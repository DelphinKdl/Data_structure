# Algorithm 1

this is a review of Intermediate data structures.

Implementations will be done using <code> C++ </code>,   <code> Java </code> ,  <code> C# </code>,   <code> Swift </code>


### Union Find

This is used to solve dynamic connectivity problem.


- We assume "is connected to" is an equivalence relation.


1- Reflexive: p is connected to p

2- Symmetric: If p is connected to q, then q is connected to p.

3- Transitive: If p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r.
