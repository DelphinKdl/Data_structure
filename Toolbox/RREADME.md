### List of problems


1- Fibonacci

- Naive solution was done by using recursion. This creates a huge tree of recursive  calls in memory.

- Good solution: Was created by using simple iteration which goves us a big O(n)

2- GCD

- Naive solution was done by an iteration which is going to take a long time to compute.

- Implementing the Euclidian algorithm by approximating the runtime.
